# Budgo

Budgo is a simple budgeting app. It asks for an amount of money to budget over a period of time, and every day gives you a random small amount of money to spend. You can keep track of your transactions through spending, and bank any money from one day to add to another.

## Getting Started

With npm and ionic installed, clone the repository, and run these two commands.

```
npm install

ionic serve --lab
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Thanks!

I made an app! It's not very clean, and a bit chunky in places, but she's mine and I love her! Thank you very much for checking out the source code, and here's to my future projects being a bit prettier!
